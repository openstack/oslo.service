    The threading backend now supports the ``spawn`` multiprocessing
    start method. If a service is spawn-safe (picklable), ``spawn``
    will be used as the default start method. Otherwise, the backend
    will automatically fall back to ``fork`` if available. This
    prevents inherited threading locks during worker respawn and
    improves compatibility with Python 3.12+.

    For more information about spawn-safe services, see
    `spawn <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods>`_.
