    The ``oslo.service.wsgi.Server`` class now includes
    backend compatibility checks to prevent improper usage with the threading
    backend. Applications using the threading backend that attempt to
    instantiate the WSGI Server will now receive an immediate
    ``UnsupportedBackendError`` exception with a clear error message.

    This is an intentional breaking change to prevent potential runtime issues
    and security concerns that could arise from using a component designed for
    eventlet in a threading environment. The fail-fast behavior ensures that
    applications using the threading backend are guided towards the correct
    deployment patterns.

    **Migration Path**: Users should migrate to deploying their WSGI
    applications using standard WSGI servers such as ``uwsgi``, ``gunicorn``,
    or similar alternatives instead of relying on the deprecated oslo.service
    WSGI server.
