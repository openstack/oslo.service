    Fixed a crash that occurred during service shutdown in the threading
    backend, caused by an incorrect call to the non-existent internal method
    ``_terminate()`` on ``cotyledon.ServiceManager``. The shutdown process now
    correctly uses the public ``shutdown()`` method, ensuring graceful and
    reliable termination of services.
