    Fixed a bug to launch the multiple workers with different service
    instance. If the first service instance was picklable the ``spawn``
    multiprocessing context was selected. Any subsequent non-picklable
    service instance also used the ``spawn`` multiprocessing context
    and raised the error.
    The launcher now re-evaluates the spawn-safe service and if it is
    not spawn-safe then fallback to ``fork`` multiprocessing context.

    See `bug 2141304 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo.service/+bug/2141304>`_.
