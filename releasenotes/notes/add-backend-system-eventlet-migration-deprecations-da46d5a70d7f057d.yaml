features:
  - |
    A new backend system has been introduced to modularize and improve
    the flexibility of the service implementation. This system allows
    developers to choose or implement alternative backends.

    By default, the ``eventlet`` backend is used, preserving the previous
    behavior. The backend is dynamically loaded through the new
    backend mechanism.
