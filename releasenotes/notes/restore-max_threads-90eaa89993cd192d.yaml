upgrade:
  - |
    The ``ThreadGroup.max_threads`` attribute has been restored for backward
    compatibility. It previously disappeared during the backend refactor
    (commit ``8c74d0718dc11ed5``), which caused consumers such as Heat to
    fail when upgrading to oslo.service 4.4.0.
    The attribute now maps to ``thread_pool_size`` and emits a
    ``DeprecationWarning``. Applications should migrate to
    ``thread_pool_size``. The deprecated attribute may be removed in a
    future release.
