    The ``threading`` backend now accepts the ``wait_interval`` argument
    in ``ProcessLauncher`` for compatibility with services like Neutron.
    The parameter is still used in the ``eventlet`` backend to reduce CPU usage
    during child monitoring loops, but has no effect in ``threading``.
    A warning is logged if it is passed.
    In addition, multiple calls to ``launch_service()`` on the same
    ``ProcessLauncher`` instance are now supported, using a single
    ``ServiceManager`` internally. This makes the threading backend fully
    compatible with how the ``eventlet`` backend behaves.
